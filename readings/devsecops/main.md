# What is DevSecOps

DevSecOps is an evolution of DevOps that integrates security practices throughout the entire software development lifecycle. It is not just about the tools and methodologies but also a mindset and culture that encourages proactivity towards security, continuous improvement, and collaboration. DevSecOps places security at the center of the DevOps process, integrating it into the continuous feedback loop rather than treating it as a separate, final phase. This is represented by "Sec" being positioned between "Dev" and "Ops" in the term itself.

It requires cultural transformation. DevSecOps aims to break down silos between development, security, business, and operations teams to create a unified approach where security becomes an integrated part of development and operations work. Collaboration is the key to success in providing secure products. Security teams provide knowledge on security areas and support in its implementation and operation. Business teams provide domain knowledge, business priorities, and business processes. Development teams implement solutions and provide knowledge about technical solutions. While operations teams ensure the solution is secured and stable after release.

A key aspect of DevSecOps is automating security practices and integrating them into CI/CD pipelines to ensure security is built into the development process from the beginning. However, it is not only about tooling and automatization. The whole lifecycle should include security aspects, from requirement collection and design through implementation to keeping and maintaining systems alive. DevSecOps distinguishes between "security in the pipeline" (securing what you build) and "security of the pipeline" (securing how you build). Modern DevSecOps leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approaches, which enable Compliance as Code (CaC) to apply static analysis to infrastructure configuration files.

# Standards and Regulations
While EU regulations do not explicitly mandate specific DevSecOps tools or practices like SCA, SAST, or Secret Management, they create an environment where integrating security throughout the development lifecycle is essential for compliance and resilience. Implementing DevSecOps practices can help organizations meet these regulatory requirements effectively. DORA encourages secure development practices that are integral to DevSecOps, such as continuous monitoring and vulnerability management. NIS2 indirectly supports the use of tools like SCA for managing open-source vulnerabilities and ensuring supply chain security, aligning with DevSecOps practices. While the CRA does not explicitly mandate DevSecOps practices like SCA or SAST, it emphasizes the need for robust cybersecurity measures throughout the product lifecycle, which aligns with DevSecOps principles.

DevSecOps, as the evolution of best practices, supports compliance with multiple regulations by underlining the importance of security. By including security into daily processes and agile workflow and providing automotive and developer-friendly solutions, DevSecOps supports efficient and agile system productions. This way, compliance can be achieved without too much cost and with a lower impact on the time to market and flexibility of the business. DevSecOps can also directly answer some requirements and regulations in more regulated industries.

As a relatively young specialization, it does not have many standards and frameworks. It rather provides solutions to existing security standards and integrates multiple other solutions into one more systematic approach. There are some guidelines and frameworks that can help with general DevSecOps implementation. OWASP provides the DevSecOps Maturity Model (DSOMM), DevSecOps Guidelines, DevSecOps Verification Standard (DSOVS), and Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM). NIST provides multiple publications, such as the Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF). MITRE created the DevSecOps Best Practice Guide. US introduced DoD DevSecOps Fundamental Guidebook and Enterprise DevSecOps Fundamentals.

# Benefits from implementing DevSecOps

## Benefits for the company

DevSecOps offers numerous benefits for companies that implement it:

- **Enhancing security and privacy:** Like all cybersecurity practices, it directly and positively impacts cybersecurity. By focusing on automation, culture, and processes and adding security into the whole lifecycle of the product, it comprehensively supports the production process in the security area. It also shortens the time required to identify and fix security and privacy issues.
- **Improve operational efficiency and time-to-market:** By adding automatization on tests, validation, monitoring, and reporting, DevSecOps supports operation and development by minimizing manual work and time required to execute some work and allows specialists to focus on more complex issues. Integrating security into all parts of the product lifecycle created with agile methodologies removes complex full-scope analyses and adjustments on the last steps of the production. Including security during the design and implementation phases forces teams to improve their understanding of the domain, business requirements, and processes. This translates directly to fewer adjustments in the final product and less fault-prompt solutions.
- **Improve audit and compliance:** Including security in the whole product lifecycle with corresponding documentation (risk assessments, system logs, CI/CD logs, etc.) helps provide the documentation required for audits. A risk-based approach to security helps identify crucial issues and helps prove the correct focus of security programs and solutions. Unified automatization of tests based on public standards and rules, helps solve any potential issues before they arise and document usage of best practices in the company. Automatization also simplifies product verification in the context of repeating issues and things identified as compliance requirements. With automatic compliance checks, teams can also ensure compliance with growing legal requirements.
- **Support collaboration and culture**: DevSecOps practices are rooted in culture and workflow changes. Implementing DevSecOps puts security and privacy as one of the company culture pillars. Spreading awareness and best practices helps build a security mindset in all teams. Cooperation is key to success in DevSecOps as it requires all teams to collaborate over the whole lifecycle of the product to ensure correct privacy and security levels. It emphasizes that security is a shared responsibility and must be aligned with company objectives. Understanding each participant's point of view, business process, and company needs is required and enforced during the cooperation.
- **Minimize risks:** By including security in the early stages of the product lifecycle, it is easier to identify risks and design systems by selecting the best approach to handle them. Automatization helps identify security and privacy issues during development and fix them before they become vulnerabilities in a final product. By making systems more reliable and secure with each step of the lifecycle, we minimize the risk of failure and breaches and minimize potential attack surfaces. Adding automatization minimizes human-connected issues like repeating the same error, forgetting about security control, etc.
- **Competitive advantage**: By prioritizing security and privacy, companies can build stronger trust relationships with their customers. With DevSecOps practices, teams can provide more secure solutions faster, which gives them more agility and helps them become compliant in new markets and business areas. Higher quality and security can distinguish them from competitors in the market. On the other hand, while DevSecOps practices are more popular, not implementing them can negatively impact the market's position.
- **Increase agility:** DevSecOps enables organizations to adapt quickly to changing business needs and customer requirements while maintaining consistent security standards. It also helps keep compliance with changes in regulations and adjust products to new market regulations.

## Benefits for individual contributors

DevSecOps also provides benefits for the individual contributors:

- **Skill Enhancement and continuous learning:** DevSecOps allows individuals (and even requires) to learn about security practices, development processes, and operational concerns. So, depending on individual roles, skills and knowledge can be broadened in other areas. All team members become more security-conscious. Developers automatically start avoiding components with known vulnerabilities and incorporating security best practices into their work. Businesses make more risk-based decisions. The fast-paced nature of security and DevSecOps encourages continuous learning.
- **Improve understanding of the big picture, processes, and other teams:** Individual contributors gain insights into how their work fits into the larger context of the organization's goals and security posture. They get a better understanding of the final product. They also get a better understanding of different parts of the product lifecycle and the teams that contribute most to them.
- **Efficiency gain:** Continuous feedback and monitoring help identify and address issues more quickly. Including security in each step of product development removes some bottlenecks. Automation of security validation and processes allows to focus on more complex work and remove repetitive tasks
- **Improved collaboration:** DevSecOps covers the whole product lifecycle, which forces different teams to collaborate. Improved understanding of the product (required to provide security) helps in cooperation, lowers the stress in collaboration, and improves communication/understanding between teams. Fostering better communication and teamwork among different roles, leads to a more cohesive and efficient work environment.
- **Career growth:** First of all, DevSecOps is becoming more widely used and more important with time; professionals with experience in this approach become more valuable. DevSecOps forces collaboration and a better understanding of the business, processes, and specific product domains. This helps to gain experience and knowledge in a specific industry. Working with different teams during the whole product lifecycle helps build connections and reputation.
- **Working with up-to-date technologies:** Security and DevOps areas evolve all the time, providing new solutions that individual contributors work with. Working with up-to-date solutions is required to keep systems secure. Removing vulnerabilities requires updates on dependencies, which force users to keep them up to date and, allow them to use new features, and improve efficiency and quality.

# Practices

DevSecOps practices are focused on the whole product lifecycle, from requirement definition and system design to building the system, testing, and deploying to sustain the production environment. It is an extension of DevOps practices, and there are a few principles that any implementation follows: shifting security practices earlier in the development process, adopting automatization and implementing continuous testing, collaboration across teams, and collective responsibility. Key here is that DevSecOps is not just the adoption of tooling, but the whole mindset and culture change.

As mentioned, the adoption of DevSecOps requires organizational and cultural changes. Data privacy and cybersecurity are not the responsibility of one person or one team; they are shared responsibility by the whole company. Security teams are in the company to support others in adopting best practices, but the security is as strong as the weakest link in the security chain. Accepting shared responsibility is the first step. The whole company must understand and include security and privacy concepts in all projects. Different training and awareness programs are important in that area, as much as people's self-awareness and will to take responsibility. The second thing is establishing good communication and cooperation across multiple teams. Security and privacy teams should be part of many discussions and should help align security and privacy requirements, controls, and their implementations. Again, awareness and training programs can help, but also champions programs. In many cases, even the best will may not be enough, and different policies and processes can help standardize some workflows and ensure minimum cooperation, privacy and security compliance.

Depending on the product lifecycle, there are a few key things to look at:

1. Plan. During the Planning phase, it is important to define privacy and security requirements. For requirements, we should select the best controls to implement. Both should be done based on the risk identified during Risk Assessments and Threat Modeling. It is important to do risk assessment and threat modeling during this phase and to prioritize correct findings. Both should be done by representatives of business, developers, ops, and security teams. Key stakeholders take responsibility for all the risks, so not doing and not documenting risk assessments and threat modeling is equal to accepting all risks (known and unknown) and taking full responsibility when those risks materialize.
2. Code. During the code phase, it is very important to use secure coding guidelines, different approved tools, and libraries. Security teams, in cooperation with engineering and developers, should create guidelines and review new tools and libraries. In some more restrictive industries, teams are allowed to use only specific tools, and libraries are often available via internal repositories. SCA and SAST solutions are often used during coding to support developers in code and dependency validation. Many teams use git hooks to block secret popularization in git and to block identified vulnerabilities from being pushed to the code base. Dependency scorecards are used to identify potential issues with new dependencies. This phase is often focused on ensuring that new code is secure and new dependencies are fine, too. Often, the license of dependencies is validated to minimize the legal and financial impact. The key is to have a code approval and code review process. Solutions like Infrastructure as Code, Compliance as Code, etc. are often used. In more restrictive industries or bigger companies, some elements of the systems are implemented and maintained by security and engineering teams, for example, authorization and authentication components.
3. Build. This phase again runs SAST, SCA, and similar tools to ensure the minimum quality in CI/CD pipelines. Depending on the maturity level and security requirements, different severity levels can block the pipeline and force developers to fix issues before the code is deployed on production. Secret management is one of the key parts of the build process. Image testing and validation are important for that part, too. A good practice is to use your own secure repositories for the artifacts and use signatures. Engineering and security teams should also collaborate on securing the CI/CD environment.
4. Test. This phase should include a full coverage of different aspects of security and privacy. Again, tools like SAST, SCA, DAST, and IAST are used. Some teams do pen-testing for bigger releases. It all depends on the automatization level and time to market. The key here is to ensure that minimum security and privacy levels are kept and defined controls are implemented. Standard test solutions can support that, for example, unit tests, feature tests, end-to-end tests, etc.
5. Deploy. Depending on the workflow, the Build/Deploy/Test phase can be mixed. The key is to ensure that production release is tested and secured - so findings with specific severity are handled. Again, important for deployment are secure builds (often signed artifacts in secure repositories), secret management, and solutions like IaC and CaC. At that stage, ensuring the correct and secure configuration of the deployments and production product is important.
6. Operate and Monitor. Often, companies run penetration tests regularly and run bug bounty programs. Additionally, tests catching all severities of issues are run to collect the full overview of the production status of the product. Again, tools like SAST, SCA, DAST, and IAST are used, and results are gathered in vulnerability management systems. The key here is to identify newly arisen vulnerabilities and issues. Even if the code has not changed, new attacks can be created, and new vulnerabilities identified in existing dependencies. Another thing, even more important, is to monitor activities and access to the systems. One of the key tools used at that stage is SIEM, which requires adjustment per system. Security analysis and audits should also be done regularly for at least critical systems. Tools like WAF can help in the context of operation.

Very important here is that some tools and security validation can give different results with different severity levels. Teams must cooperate to adjust all the workflow and settings. The key is to catch real critical and high-severity issues before they reach production and fix them. Lower severity issues and mid-severity issues can be treated as technical debt that teams can handle later. The severity of specific findings can be adjusted together based on threat modeling and risk assessments. Any tools should run fast on the new code and ensure that it blocks only predefined severity levels to reach production. In the local environment, developers should be able to catch issues and fix them before pushing code to the shared repository, but CI/CD pipelines are responsible for blocking unsecured changes. As new vulnerabilities and threats are identified, it is important to continuously test existing systems and inform the teams responsible for the system as soon as new issues arise. The corresponding processes should exist to enforce fixing the problem. For example, a new vulnerability can be identified for an existing dependency even if no new code is deployed; the team responsible for the system should review that vulnerability and remove it (by updating the dependency or removing it) or accept risk (when vulnerability can't be exploited in the system).
