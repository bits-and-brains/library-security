The repository contains two sections:

- Materials - a collection of links to articles, blogs, books, podcasts, tools, etc.
- Readings - some reading materials and infographics that describe some concepts, provide guidelines and explain some topics. Some texts only present an area of a specific topic roughly, while others dive deeper into the topic and provide a better explanation with examples and guidelines.

The idea of the repository is to have an open, shared location to collect and share knowledge and materials.
